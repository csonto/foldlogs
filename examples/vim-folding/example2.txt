== Showcase Folding with Explicit Fold Levels ==

Like in Vim folds can be created at any level (1 up to 9) when marker `{{{` or
`}}}` is followed by a number. This works pretty well as you can see:

Tiny fold {{{1
  This tiny fold is not even created
}}}1 End of tiny fold.

Few more lines are needed:
Larger fold {{{1
  level1
  level1
  level1
}}}1 End of larger fold

Nested fold {{{1
  level1
  {{{2
    level2
    level2
    level2
  }}}2
  level1
  level1
  {{{2
    level2
    level2
    level2
  }}}2
  level1
  level1
}}}1 End of nested fold

=== Let's try some mismatched levels ===
Starting with higher level:
{{{3
level3
level3
level3
}}}3
level2
}}}2
level1
}}}1

{{{1
level1
{{{2
level2
{{{3
level3
level3
level3
level3
}}}1
...and closing all open folds here ^

{{{1
level1
{{{2
level2
{{{3
level3
skipping to level 5 {{{5
level5
level5
}}}9 - ignored. Level 9 was not open
still level5
...and now closing levels by opening new lower level fold {{{2
level2
level2
level2
level2
...and starting a new level1 fold {{{1
new level1
new level1
new level1
}}}1

...and a last level without closing marker {{{1
level1 kept open
level1 kept open
level1 kept open
level1 kept open
level1 kept open
