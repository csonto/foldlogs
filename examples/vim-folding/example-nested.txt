== Nesting Showcase ==

Nesting does not work (yet.)
If nested contexts are created `{{{` matches the start `.re` for all of them.
And first `}}}` encountered closes them all.

Nested fold {{{
  level1
  {{{
    level2
    level2
    level2
  }}}
  level1
  level1
  {{{
    level2
    level2
    level2
  }}}
  level1
  level1
}}} End of nested fold
